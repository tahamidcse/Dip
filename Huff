The first step in Huffman’s approach is to create a series of source
reductions by ordering the probabilities(frequencies/totalpixel) of the
symbols under consideration, then combining the lowest probability
symbols into a single symbol that replaces them in the next source
reduction
3 The second step in Huffman’s procedure is to code each reduced source,
starting with the smallest source and working back to the original
source
4 Huffman’s procedure creates the optimal code for a set of symbols and
probabilities subject to the constraint that the symbols be coded one
at a time. After the code has been created, coding and/or error-free
decoding is accomplished in a simple lookup table manner.
5 the interesting part or difficult part of Huffman coding was generating
the codes and generating the tree.Here we only code the leaf node.This
part was tricky.Also merging the frequency/probability to construct
the tree was tricky.As there can be more than one tree to achieve
compression
6 we can see that compression ratio of raw image is less than both jpg
and png image.As raw image dont use any standard coding system like
jpg or png huffman compression cant perform much compression on
raw image.
7 Also after Decompression and reconstruction we observed that it is a
lossless compression
